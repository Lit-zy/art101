                <h2>Problems</h2>
                <p>I came across multiple errors, specifcally syntax errors, which was something that could have been prevented if I was testing every line of code before typing everything out. I also had problems with displaying my output but I was able to use a classmates reference on discord to help with that.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="minor-section">
                <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <p>Overall this was so far one of the most stressful labs, but it was rewarding when I was able to fix all my errors and have my function run smoothly. </p>
