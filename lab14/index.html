        <h2>Challenge</h2>
        <p>The challenge for this lab was to pick and debug a lab using the tools we've learned in class! </p>
    </div>

    <div id="Problems">
        <h2>Problems</h2>
        <p>The only problem for this lab was figuring out how I was going to figure out where the error was coming from. After careful inspection I found that the error was simply a callback error where I was using the wrong ID name for my image. I also wasn't properly adding my image on HTML.</p>

    <div id="Results">
        <h2>Results</h2>
       <p>View Debugging screenshots or go back to homepage to view edited version of Lab 9 </p>
       
       </div>


       <div id="Debug">
        <h2>Debugging</h2>
        <p>At the end I was able to get my Lab 9 all debugged. I successfully created a button that when before being clicked there would be no image, and once clicked an image would pop up. Although it might seem like a simple task, at the time of this lab I was having trouble figruing out my error </p>
