            <h1>Challenge</h1>
            <p>The challenge for this lab was to actively use jQuery to add buttons and event listener to our lab page.  </p>

            <h1>Problems</h1>
            <p>One of the problems that I faced in this lab was that even though I had my jQuery library attached to my HTML file, nothing was showing up on my console.
                 I later went back to the slides and found that I needed to list the library before my own JS file. Another setback was that I had a few typos, 
                 not that noticable that my console would mark them red, but enough so that my code wouldn't run properly. After fixing these minimal problems all went smoothly
                I also tried to display pop up images once the buttons were clicked but was only successful in one of the buttons and not the rest. I still don't know how to fix it.  </p>

        </div>
                 

        <div id="Results">
            <h1>Results</h1>
            <p>The results include the buttons that appear on this page, and how they effecticely display this response. Another part is being able to press it and have the response go away.</p>

            <body>
                <h2>JavaScript Section</h2>
                <p> The console will include an in depth description of my JavaScript code. The image will also display what it looks like on my code editor: VSCode.</p>
