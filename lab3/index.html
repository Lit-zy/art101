			<h1>Lab 3 - File Structure and File Transfer</h1>

		<div class="minor-section">
			<h2>Lab Description:</h2>
			<p>In this lab we were asked to edit our homepage using HTML and CSS features we learned. Through this process, I applied file organization and was ale to edit file structures and transfer them through VSCode. </p>

					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>One of the challenges I faced was getting my images to show up on my homepage website.What would happen is that I would write the code to link images but it kept saying that the file was empty, and I later realized I was just putting my file in the wrong spot. This was an important lesson for keeping everything organized. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2> Problem</h2>
				<p>A problem that came up during this lab was getting the sizing correct on my images. I recalled that we had to work on the styling factors on a css file and then edit image features. I was confused on whether I had to put the width information on my homepage css file or site css file, but eventually figured it out. </p>

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Overall, even though the process of this assingment was high and low it was really rewarding to see my website gain new features. At first, I was stressed out with figuring out correct formating in html, but once that got sorted I was able to enjoy the process of my assingment. </p>
