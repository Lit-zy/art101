        <h2>Challenge</h2>
        <p>For this lab was to create a function that depends on conditonals. The resulted output would need to be a theme we chose alongside the inputed name, and I chose Avatar: The Last Airbender  </p>

        <h2>Problems</h2>
        <p>I ran into so many problems during this lab. It defiently challenged me the most, but one of the main issues I had was that when the user inputed a name, instead of getting back a theme the output would be a number. It took me 2 days to figure out, but luckily WesBot was able to help me figure it out. </p>
