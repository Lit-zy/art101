// Define Variables

//Create a variable called carName and assign the value "Taurus" to it, then print it.
let carName = "Camry";
//Create a variable called carYear and assign the value to 1995 to it and display it.
let carYear = 2014;
//Create and assign a variable called currentYear
let curentYear = 2025;
//Create a variable called carColor and assign the value "Gray" to it 
let carColor = "Gray";
//Create a boolean variable called ownIt and assign the value "True"
let ownIt= true;

// Calculate

//Assign carAge to the difference between currentYear and carYear and display it.
let carAge = curentYear - carYear; 

// output
document.writeln("Make:" + carName + "<br>");
document.writeln("Year:" + carYear + "<br>");
document.writeln("Color:" + carColor + "<br>");
document.writeln("Own-It:" + true + "<br>");
document.writeln ("Age:" + carAge + "years<br>");

// this is an example function and this comment tells what it doees and what parameters are passed to it.
function myFunction(param1, param2) {
  // some code here
  // return results;
}



// let's get this party started
main();
