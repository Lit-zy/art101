        <h2>Problems</h2>
        <p>One of the problems I had with this lab was that on my console my code was working properly and showing all the information. However, I was having a hard time displaying the cat image on the output. I was able to get help from my TA during lab as well as using Wesbot and I was able to figure out. The problem was that I was treating the data as one image but instead of multiple ones so I had to loop over the data.</p>
