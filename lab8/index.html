            <h1>Lab 8: Anon Functions and Callbacks</h1>
            <h1>Challenge</h1>
            <p>Experimenting with the map function using callback functions</p>
            <h1>Problems</h1>
            <p>While it wasn't so much of a problem, I was confused about the fact that my output wasn't displaying onto the webpage. It wasn't until I saw further instructions that I realized that due to the new JavaScript input on index.html it wouldn't display unless I added Task X.   </p>
            <h1>Results</h1>
            <p>This is an image of the console for this lab:
            <img id="lab-console" src="img/console .png"></p>

                <h2>JavaScript Section</h2>
                <p> Go to console to view the results of the lab! </p>
