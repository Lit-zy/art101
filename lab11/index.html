            <h1>Challenge</h1>
            <p>The challenge for this lab was to continue using jquery to experiment with JS events. 
                We used elements from a previous lab to user input a name and randomly sort the string. 
                There were minimal challenges given that we used similar JavaScript codes previously, 
                and we went over an example during lecture that was super helpful.

            <h1>Problems</h1>
            <p>One of the problems I had with this lab was that my input bubble and submit button would appear on my screen but nothing was happenign when the button was clicked. 
                 I was able to use console.log to make sure everything was added correctly and there were no errors on that part.
                During lab, Vidyah was able to help me figure out that I was inputting my code outside of the curly brackets and paranthesis. 
                Once I put everything in it's correct order it ran smoothly!</p>
