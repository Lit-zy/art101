			<h1>Lab 4 - Pseudocoding and Problem-Solving</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Lab Description</h2>
				<p> For this lab we were practixing pseudocoding and being able to transfer that into JavaScript on our Lab4 file. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>One of the challenges I faced with this lab was attaching my javascript file onto my lab4 index.html file. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>A problem that I faced was my linking my JavaScript file link and it not being read. With the help of my TA I was able to make changes to my file name so that it would be identified correctly.  </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>The process of Pseudocoding makes sense to me because it is similar to sketching out a drawing before commiting to painting it on a canvas. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p> Below are my results of the JavaScript pseudocoding:</p>
					<pre><code>
						<script type="text/javascript" src="js/lab.js" DEFER></script>
// How to create a paper collage of the sun: 
// Gather necessary materials: construction paper for base, magazines, scissors, an Exacto knife, glue stick, Modge Podge gloss, and one foam brush. 
// Skim through a magazine and identify and gather different shades of yellow.
     // Use scissors to cut the paper from the magazine or rip it out with your hands.
// Using the scissors, cut out various shapes of these yellow shades. 
    // For a more advanced technique, use an Exacto knife instead of scissors for a cleaner cut.
// Use the glue stick to start attaching the various shapes of magazine paper onto the construction base paper. 
    // Make sure you are creating a circle shape with your magazine paper to mimic the shape of the sun. 
// Continue to layer different shapes and shades of yellow magazine paper, using a layering technique.
    // Remember to let the glued paper dry in between to prevent tearing. 
// Once you have formed a circle shape to mimic the sun, use scissors to cut out triangle-shaped pieces of magazine paper. 
    // You will need to cut out a minimum of eight triangle-shaped pieces of magazine paper.
// Use the glue stick to attach the triangle-shaped pieces to the outer edges of the circle shape to mimic rays of the sun. 
    //Remember to evenly distribute the eight pieces of magazine paper around the circle, you may need to cut more. 
// Let all the pieces you glued on the construction paper dry for a minimum of an hour 
// Once the pieces have dried, use the foam brush to add a layer of the Modge  Podge gloss to properly seal your collage 
    // Make sure you evenly distribute the gloss and cover the whole paper. 
// Set out to dry on an even surface for a minimum of an hour  
// Finished!
