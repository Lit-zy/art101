        <h2>Challenge</h2>
        <p>The challenge for this lab was to use the comic API docs and test the endpoints. By using a jQuery .ajax recipe we were able to create a working comic output. </p>

    <div id="Problems">
        <h2>Problems</h2>
        <p>Like many of my classmates, one of the problems for this lab was that the URL provided to us on the assingment would not work in our console. We were all getting a X"" error on our console.
            Even the professor during lecture did not know what the issue was. Since I am a beginner coder, it was hard for me to identify the root of the problem so I started by the basics of going line by line and checking my console for errors. 
        </p>

    <div id="Results">
        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>In the end, one of my classmates Syd, posted a working URL on our discord channel, and once that was plugged in, my code successfully worked! Below is the working result. Syd added that by using a proxy on the URL it would fix it. </p>
